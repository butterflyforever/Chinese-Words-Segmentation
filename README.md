## Comment

Quite naive right? LOL. This is the first project in our university. I just entered the SJTU for 3 months. This project really revoked me the interets about programming. I am really grateful to it.

I know our group made many mistakes such as Program Name, code structure, comment and so on. But I don't want to clean it now. Just leave them here and they will be a precious memory.
